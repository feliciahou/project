	<h2>Bienvenue, Willkommen, Welcome</h2>
	<p>Welcome to Gone Backpacking - the adventures of a chronic over-packer just trying to make her way across the globe!</p>
    <p>In my 33 years of life thus lived, I have travelled to 18 countries where I have scuba dived, bungee jumped, wedding crashed, ate amazing meals, worked, got lost, slept in the car, accidentally hit a kangaroo, and most importantly - made lifelong friends.</p>
    <p>This is a space for documenting my past travels, sharing plans for future trips, and inspiring others to get lost and find adventures!</p>

    <p>Back in 2006, I signed up with the <a href="http://www.habitatglobalvillage.ca/" target="_blank">Habitat for Humanity Global Village program</a> and travelled to Zambia with a team of 15 other Canadians and Americans to build houses and relationships with the locals.</p>
    <p>From the capital, Lusaka, we travelled 18 hours by bus on a dirt road to the small village of Mufumbwe. The locals greeted us with the most welcome of cheers and hugs, which brought all of us to tears.</p> 
    <p>Together with the locals, we built a brick house, shared songs and stories, and cooked each other meals around a campfire (the Zambians thought our pasta was really weird)! I love how Zambia is so full of vibrant culture, and life there seems to revolve around music and dancing. Everyone we met loved to dance and even Church on Sundays was all about the dancing and singing.</p>

    </div>
	<p>Aside from building and working, we also went on a couple of safaris and even visited the majestic Victoria Falls in Livingstone.</p>
    <p>I didn't know that a country could have such a lasting imprint in my memory and have such an impact on my outlook on life. Should you choose to go to Zambia, be warned that you may never want to come back! The saying is true - Africa gets into your blood.</p>

    <h1 id="turkey">Ten Days in Turkey</h1>
    <div class="floatleft">
    	<figure class="rotateleft">
        <img src="images/bluemosque.jpg" alt="the Blue Mosque" width="300" height="229">
        <figcaption>The Blue Mosque, Istanbul</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div><!-- end floatleft -->    
        <p>In 2007, I hopped on a flight bound for Istanbul and spent ten days surrounded by amazing architecture, colourful textiles, and exotic aromas and sounds. Two of my friends, who happened to have families in Turkey, agreed to give me the grand tour and also let me stay with them. We toured Istanbul, Antalya, Kemer, and Ankara.</p>
        <p>One of my favourite sights was the beautiful Blue Mosque. Women are required to cover up prior to entering, and the mosque staff were kind enough to provide me with a head scarf and a long skirt to wear while touring the mosque.</p> 
        <p>Turkey is a great destination for backpackers who are travelling on a shoe string. My favourite thing to eat was lahmacun, a flatbread topped with minced meat, tomatoes, cheese, and onions. You could say it was the Turkish version of pizza. And best of all, a lahmacun would cost you approximately $1.50!</p>
     <div class="floatright">

     </div>   
        <p>If you're a coffee lover, a must-do is drink a traditional Turkish coffee. The coffee is prepared by directly boiling the grounds in a pot of water. This results in a really strong, thick, and rich coffee, so you might want to drink water in between sips of coffee!</p> 
        <p>If I were to go back to Turkey, I would go on a hot air balloon ride over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia" target="_blank">Cappadocia</a> and soak my feet in the many hotsprings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamukkale" target="_blank">Pamukkale</a>. One can dream, right!?

    	<h1 id="html5">Two New HTML5 Tags used on this Page</h1>
        <h2>Video Element</h2>
        <p>The HTML5 video element supports native play of video directly in the browser; it does not require additional plug-ins or media players to display the video file. To configure this element, use an opening &lt;video&gt; tag and a closing &lt;/video&gt; tag.</p>
        <p>Attributes for the video element include:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>src - the value of this attribute is the file name of the video</li>
            <li>controls - the value is "controls" and configures the display of player controls</li> 
            <li>title - the value is a text description of the video; it is intended for assistive technologies or screen readers</li>
            <li>width - the value is a number and it configures the size of the video on the page, in pixels.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>The HTML5 video element is supported by current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera. It is also supported by Internet Explorer 9, but not in older versions of Internet Explorer. For this reason, I've included a link to download the video in case the user is using a browser that does not support this element.</p>
        <p>It is also important to configure more than one version of the video file, as browser support for different containers and codecs may vary. Hence in this example, I have offered the video file in both OGG and MP4 containers.</p>
        <p>I chose to use the HTML5 video element to add a level of interactivity to this webpage and as it wasn't demonstrated in class, I wanted to learn how to configure this element.</p> 
        <h2>Audio Element</h2>
        <p>Similar to the HTML5 video element, the HTML5 audio element makes it possible for audio files to play directly in the browser without the need of additional plug-ins or media players. In other words, audio and video are now native to the browser in HTML5. To configure this element, use an opening &lt;audio&gt; tag and a closing &lt;/audio&gt; tag.</p>
        <p>Attributes for the audio element include:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>src - the value of this attribute is the file name of the audio</li>
            <li>type - the value is the MIME type of the audio file</li>
            <li>autoplay - the value is "autoplay" and this attribute configures the audio to automatically start playing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The HTML5 audio element is supported by current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer 9. Earlier versions of IE do not support this element. Similar to the HTML5 video element, it is important to provide multiple versions of the audio file to satisfy different levels of browser support for containers and codecs. In this example, I have provided the audio file in both MP3 and OGG format.</p>
